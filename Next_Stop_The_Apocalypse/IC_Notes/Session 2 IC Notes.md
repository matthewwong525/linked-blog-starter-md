# Session 2 IC Notes

### Ready room
After hearing the plan and the [[Quest nr1]] we discussed how to get more information. After deciding to go to the library, we needed to know how to get access. After calling the clerk asking for more information I once again got confronted with my past. That was not ideal, during this state of shock I spent 2 gold on a drink which then got drunk by [[Lucy]]. Lucy got a bit to drunk and caused a together with [[Enoki]] they burned the roof but I cleaned it a little. It is good to know that [[Squid Ink liquor]] is highly flammable. I need to ask extra clarification on the cups at they seemed invisible.
During this state of drunkenness Lucy managed to piss off the clerk who then cast [[calm emotions]] on us. During this high state I grabbed my student card and got lightning in the face from a version of the glyph of warding spell I apparently cast myself. The envelope was plastered with **DO NOT OPEN** After the lighting blast I got enough sense knocked into me to not open the envelope. 

### Library
The library was [[Luminous Library]], When entering the library we where asked to present our [[QPD cards]] when trying to scan the [[UMDA Student Card]] it did not scan and let me past. We spend about 3 hours in the library for research. During this time I tried my student card again and it ended up working. Going back up I was stopped by a cleric who I tricked by telling her that I got pranked. This seemed to have worked but my pass still would not scan when going back up

  <p>OC: Is this because this is not the first time Myrthal is in this library and his access was improperly revoked and this would explain why he had access to previous floors. </p>

This floor did not contain anything interesting except feyology and demonology. 
when going back, I noticed a small button at the back where we got the book on Lesser demons from. This opened a small hidden compartment containing a spell scroll of [[Summon Lesser Demon]]. which was tagged using an abjuration sigil which I promptly disposed of in the toilet. After which I continued with the research on the [[Bone Devil]]. My antics seemed to have drawn the attention of [[Enoki]] who later asked me what I was doing. 

# Road to House of the Dead
Nothing Interesting happened totally. I nearly fell when I was discussing the scroll with [[Enoki]] and [[Hayden]] seemed a bit wierd for a second but that must have been just my brain playing tricks.
