# Notes session one
the day was.....?

Today was quite eventful, I met with the group who I will be working with for the next month or so they are a good bunch but have their oddities. We are now a group of 5.

There is a fairy named [[Dew]] who has definitely studied at UMDA and has a mechanical lizard named Scarner which is currently on version 4.

There is a Tiefling called [[Lucy]] who has a weird magical bracer that seems to give her power. She seems to have powers similar to clerics but her bracer does some weird things.

there was a human named [[Enoki]] who has a weird mushroom in her hair and is carrying a bluish staff. 

Finally there is [[Haiden]] who seemed to be able to manifest a an echo of himself this echo was not effected by a psychic mug and seemed to pass straight through. I have never seen or heard anything about this and need to do some more investigation on this echo.

our introductions got interuped when I got stabbed by an assasin who used a blade made out of arcane quartz. a wizardsslayer attack was used killing me instantly but I was brought back due to my ring. Which broke one of the crystals. This seems to bring me back from the dead but at the cost of one of the crystals. It might have some more unforseen consuquences. The ring felt warm when I was dead.

The assasin was also quite interesting. It seemed to have non-corporeal movement. It also had acces to a really powerfull spell named [[Detonation Surge]] A high level spell like 5+ that kills the user. The spell should be highly regulated by [[UMDA]] with limited acces. Could this be a group who has broken in to UMDA or is it UMDA itself? More information is needed before I can draw a conclusion. But UMDA might be up to some shady stuff.

Finally we met with [[Tsuri Gi]] the questgiver who can apparently read minds and is a Githzera. We got a [[Quest nr1]] There should be maps of the dungeons but the dungeon seems to change after it got reset by [[Babyl, God of Adventurers and Dungeons]]. we have to expect a bone devil undeads and lesser devils and demons.
